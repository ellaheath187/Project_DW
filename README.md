# Project_DW - March Madness Seed Performance Analysis
This project explores trends and patterns in NCAA March Madness tournament outcomes by analyzing historical data on team seedings, game results, and head-to-head seed matchups. The goal is to identify how seed rankings influence performance, especially in terms of upsets, Final Four appearances, and overall win-loss records.

## Key Analysis Questions
- In the first round, is there a higher seed that is more likely to lose as a result of an upset/ is there a lower seed that’s more likely to win as a result of an upset? 
- Do some seeds win significantly more than other seeds? 
- Is there a relationship between a seed’s overall tournament win percentage and the percentage of total Final Four appearances that seed accounts for? 
- Predict how many rounds a seed will go based on their wins, losses, best finish, and best finish count.
- Based off historical data, how many total upsets will there be in the next 5 tournaments (2025-2029)? 

## Repository Structure
- Data: includes a raw data folder and processed data folder before and after data cleaning
- Documentation: includes the project proposal and final report
- Jupyter Notebooks: includes the python code used to web scrape, clean data, and answer proposed analysis questions.
